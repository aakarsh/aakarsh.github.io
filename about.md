<p class="message"> In our acquisition of knowledge of the Universe
(whether mathematical or otherwise) that which renovates the quest is
nothing more nor less than complete innocence. It is in this state of
complete innocence that we receive everything from the moment of our
birth. Although so often the object of our contempt and of our private
fears, it is always in us. It alone can unite humility with boldness
so as to allow us to penetrate to the heart of things, or allow things
to enter us and taken possession of us. ~Alexander Grothendieck

While I myself cannot claim to possess any special knowledge of any
topics. I do find this idea of openness and exploration and above all
innocence to be highly appealing. I hope this place to be where I can
write down, summarize, synthesize topics as I learn them. Always
trying to regain and perhaps retain a sense of openness to new ideas.

If you are looking for a place where I generally leave my code then
that can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/aakarsh).

Have questions or suggestions? [ask me on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/aakarsh). Or simply leave a comment on
one of my posts.

Thanks for reading!
