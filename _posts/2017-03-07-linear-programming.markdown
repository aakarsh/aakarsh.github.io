Many common optimization problems can be reduced to instances of
linear programming. Generaly speaking Linear programming problems are
problems where given a linear set of inequaities \\(Ax \leq b\\) we
must try to maximize a certain objective function \\(c^{T}x \\) while
\\( x \geq 0 \\).


$$
max c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2 + c_3 x_3 + \cdots + c_n x_n

a_{i1} x_1 + a_{i2} x_2 + \cdots + a_{in} x_n \leq b_i
