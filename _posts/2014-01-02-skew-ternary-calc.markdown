This post is my attempt to try to summarize or at least describe 
in more detail the content of the lecture.

* Introduction

What is the coolest thing we learnt about trees? 
What is the connection between planar graphs and terenary trees ?
Something new that is not far away from basic princples.
 
* Define Skew Terenary Trees 
* Describe Why are they interesting 
* Relationship of skew terenary trees and planar graphs
* Description of knuths program 
* My extened program along with gist from github.
