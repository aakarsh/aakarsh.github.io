Some notes on group theory. Proof sketches, interesting
theorems. Possible future directions.The reference book for this will
be I.J Herstein's Abstract Algebra : Theory and Practice

* Groups
  * Definition of a Group
    * `Group:` A non empty set of elements `G` is said to form a `group`
      if in `G` there is a defined `binary operation` called `product`
      and denoted by `.` such that
        * `closure` : $ a,b \in G $ implies that $ a.b \in G $
        * `associativity`:$ a,b,c \in G $ implies that $ a.(b.c) = (a.b).c $
        * `identity`: $ \exits e \in G $ s.t $ a.e = e.a = a \forall a \in G $
        * `inverse` : $\forall a \in G $ $ \exits a^{-1} \in G $ s.t $ a.a^{-1} = e $
        
    * `Abelian(Commutative) Group` : A `group G` s.t $ \forall a,b \in G , a.b = b.a $
