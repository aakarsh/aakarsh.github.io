This cheat sheet will be used to provide a very basic reference to
using evil mode , vi emulation layer inside of emacs. For people who
would want to still have access to base emacs lisp layer while working
with vim's modal, noun verb editing features. Since evil-mode is
trying its best to emulate vim, this post might even serve as a basic
reference to vim's editing features for folks familiar emacs with
cursory (no pun intended) curiosity with vim.

### Introduction

Evil mode for emacs has been out for a while and is available to clone
from

```bash
     $ git clone https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil.git
```

It can be installed by cloning the above repo into your `.emacs.d/site-isp` and adding it to your `load-path`:

```emacslisp
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/evil")
     (require 'evil)
     (evil-mode 1)
```
